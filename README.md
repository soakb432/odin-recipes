# Odin Recipes Website

My first official "project" for The Odin Project.

## What I've applied and reinforced during this project
- Basic HTML sintax.
- Usage of Git to save my projects on GitHub, and restore them to a previous state.
- CSS properties, work with selectors & specificity, get used to the box model.
