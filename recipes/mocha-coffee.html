  <h3>If you have a coffee machine, treat yourself to a comforting, chocolatey mocha. You don't need to be a trained barista with our easy recipe.</h3>
  
  <p>Itâ€™s sweet, chocolatey, and takes hardly more time to make than adding cream and sugar to your morning coffee so it can be the thrown-together treat that gets you through a crazy busy morning or something to sip slowly on a lazy Sunday morning.</p>
  <p>Relatively simple to make, the mocha is a great option for those that want a fusion between a luxurious hot chocolate and a normal latte/cappuccino and can't quite decide what to choose.</p>
